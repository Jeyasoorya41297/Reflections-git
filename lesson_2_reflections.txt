1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialise a repository git starts to keep track of the files
in it when we make commits.
It is needed because , only after doing this we will be able to
keep track of the older versions of the files in the repository.

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository and the working directory exist but staging area is just a 
concept used to explain how we add files to a repository so that
git keeps track of it. It offers us the freedom to choose the 
files that are to be tracked (technically the changes to be commited).

3)How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

git diff --staged gives the difference between the latest commit and the staging area . 
By using this I will make sure that there is only one logical change per commit.

4)What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

-Experimental versions
-New language versions
-Making the program attractive
In all the above cases we are working on a seperate branch. So we have a working version
with us which we can show to others.
