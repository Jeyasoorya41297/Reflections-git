1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want other programmers to contribute to my code I will use a remote repository .

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes we do not want to include the changes in GitHub to our
local repository . In such situations its better to have a
manual pull rather than git automatically doing the job .

3)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks : Copying a repository from some other account to our own
account in github wihtout involving our local machines.
Clones : Copying from github to our local machines.
Branches : These are used by us to build some experimental
feature. We push a branch into github . Other than that
it has nothing to do with it.

4)What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is beneficial in the sense that if you have made changes on github
this local label helps us to identify it.
