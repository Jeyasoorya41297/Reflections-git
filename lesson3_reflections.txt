1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want other programmers to contribute to my code I will use a remote repository .

2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes we do not want to include the changes in GitHub to our
local repository . In such situations its better to have a
manual pull rather than git automatically doing the job .
